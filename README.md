After two weeks of learning Python on ***JC Data Science Program at Purwadhika***, we must do a capstone project everytime we finished the module exam in this capstone project we must do a **CRUD** function (**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete).

At this capstone project of mine I decided to take Warehouse Dataset. At this dataset, the warehouse's location will be divided into two different warehouses **Jakarta** and **Bandung** Warehouse, beside that at those two warehouses the goods that will be storing are **FMCG** and **FRESH** products FMCG product are basically daily goods such as instant noodle, packed tea, snacks; and FRESH product are products that cannot sustain for long time such as chicken fillet and egg.
