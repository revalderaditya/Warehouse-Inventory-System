After two weeks of learning Python on <em><strong>JC Data Science Program at Purwadhika</em></strong>, we must do a capstone project everytime we finished the module exam in this capstone project we must do a <strong>CRUD</strong> function (<strong>C</strong>reate, <strong>R</strong>ead, <strong>U</strong>pdate, and <strong>D</strong>elete).

At this capstone project of mine I decided to take Warehouse Dataset. At this dataset, the warehouse's location will be divided into two different warehouses <strong>Jakarta</strong> and <strong>Bandung</strong> Warehouse, beside that at those two warehouses the goods that will be storing are <strong>FMCG</strong> and <strong>FRESH</strong> products FMCG product are basically daily goods such as instant noodle, packed tea, snacks; and FRESH product are products that cannot sustain for long time such as chicken fillet and egg.<br>
